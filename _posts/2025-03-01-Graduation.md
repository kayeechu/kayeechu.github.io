*This will be a short creative writing piece. This is not meant to be a serious post,*
*and it is meant to be some writing practice for me.*

### This is it.

A serious air hangs in the school gymnasium - not a single sound can be heard.
Anticipated eyes watch as our school principal steps onto the stage, bows, then begins
the ceremony.

My first set of high school students will be graduating. It's their last day as
a student, and they will finally become adults of this world. My heart races at the
thought. What kind of new experiences will they encounter? What exciting things will
they seek? What stories will they tell a couple years, or even a decade later?

As the students leave with smiles, warmth spreads in my chest.

Even if I cannot convey my feelings, I hope they understand that I wish them the best.

I think it's easy for teachers to become jaded and tired; I've definitely seen it for myself.
Especially in recent times when it's common for apathy and disrespect to become the controllers of
the classroom. Students giving nothing for school. No effort. Less smiles. Tired eyes. More distrust.
