Hi!

My name is Ka-Yee Chu, I'm a sixth year Computer Engineering student at UBC who actually just wants to teach.

This section is going to be about me (as a person) and this website, so if you're interested in seeing my
professional experience/cv, please visit **[here](/experience/)**.

Otherwise, welcome! This is the place where I get to dump whatever weird ideas, thoughts, or progress reports
on experiments, as well as any professional opportunities I've experienced.

I'm hoping to use this website as a way for me to keep track of the projects I work on, whether they're for work
or for satisfying my own personal curiosity. 

In 2023, I've had the wonderful opportunity to audit a Masters course on Inclusive Makerspaces (ETEC 565S) at UBC
taught by the wonderful Dr. Keri Ewart. As a part of that course, the students were required to create an e-portfolio.
Despite me auditing as an undergrad student, I decided to create an **[e-portfolio](/e-portfolio/main.md)** of my own.
